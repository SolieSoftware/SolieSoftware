PROJECTS

Database Engine (C++) | Educational RDBMS Implementation              github.com/.../db-engine
- Built relational database management system from scratch in C++17 with disk-based B+ tree 
  indexing, LRU buffer pool manager, and page-oriented storage architecture
- Implemented core components: disk manager, slotted pages, table heap, and balanced B+ tree 
  supporting O(log n) search, insert, delete operations
- Achieved <50μs buffer pool hit rate and ~5ms disk I/O through cache-optimized data structures
→ C++17, systems programming, data structures, memory management, performance optimization

Smart Web Scraper | Autonomous AI Agent for E-commerce                github.com/.../smart-scraper
- Architected agentic web scraping system using LangChain and GPT-4 for autonomous product 
  discovery and extraction based on natural language prompts
- Integrated SerpAPI for search, Playwright for dynamic content rendering, and LLM-based 
  extraction handling diverse HTML structures without custom selectors
- Deployed with PostgreSQL storage, image management, and ethical scraping (rate limits, delays)
→ LangChain, GPT-4, Playwright, PostgreSQL, agentic AI, autonomous systems

HireVue Simulator | AI-Powered Interview Preparation                  github.com/.../hirevue
